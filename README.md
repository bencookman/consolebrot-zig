# consolebrot-zig
## Introduction
Reacreation of my [original C# Consolebrot](https://github.com/bencookman/consolebrot), rewritten in zig to help me learn the language.

Currently Windows platforms do not work, due to [this issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6845). I'm hoping to add Windows support in the future.

## Installation
Simply clone the GitHub repository (repo) and build the zig project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bencookman/consolebrot-zig # Clone the repo
cd consolebrot-zig                                      # Move into the repo
zig build                                               # Build the project
./zig-out/bin/consolebrot                               # Run the binary
```
